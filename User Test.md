# Responses/feedbacks from users
User1
- Background: He barely has experience using chatbot and only used Amazon Alexa before. It was annoying that he had to say “Alexa,” every time he needed to talk to the chatbot.
- During an answering question via *Hello Plant*, there was a short pause moment that he was thinking about his next sentence to answer, but the chatbot assumed he finished his reply. Then, the chatbot started to respond to his answer. It didn’t let him finish his response.
- Not sure with a score system: what is this score for? maybe not score, feedbacks or suggestions? Score makes him more despondent. If a user get lower percentage, the chatbot suggests to practice the same question again?
- Just random questions? Sounds like no goal. Maybe pick one specific company and set questions for that company?
- A lot of times, fear of interviewing comes from the environment, not just the questions.


User2
- Background: Her previous chatbot experience is also Amazon Alexa.
- *Hello Plant* reminds her Amazon Alexa.
- Interface of the chatbot is not convincing enough.
- At the starting point, there is no clue or it is too broad what to say or where to start.
- A gray microphone is so confused. Don’t know it is recording or not.
- If the interface goes smoothly, it will be helpful for her to improve her interview skills.
- A plant image and interviewing bot is kind of awkward combination.
